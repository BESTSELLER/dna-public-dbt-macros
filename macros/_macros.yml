    description: >
      This macro will overwrite the dbt-core built-in macro for generating schema names. 
      It wil instead generate environment-based schema names. When there is a custom schema name, 
      it will create the schema with the custom name in production, 
      and <default_name>_<custom_name> for all other environments. 
      When there is no custom schema name, it will have the default name as schema name. 
      Requirement is that the dbt project has set an environment variable `DBT_ENV_NAME` which is set to 
      `prod` for the production enviornment.
      dbtLabs' docs and thoughts about the macro can be found [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas#changing-the-way-dbt-generates-a-schema-name).
